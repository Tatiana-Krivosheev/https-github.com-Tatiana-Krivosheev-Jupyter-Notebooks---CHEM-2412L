    "Place 1 mL of concentrated nitric acid in a 25 or 50-mL Erlenmeyer flask. Add 1 mL of concentrated sulfuric acid to the flask. The temperature will rise somewhat; cool the flask in a cold water bath for 1-2 minutes. Using a pipet, add 1 mL of toluene dropwise while swirling the flask (Do this at your bench. Do not add the toluene directly to the flask from the buret dispenser). Pace the addition of the toluene so that it takes 10-15 minutes to add the toluene. The temperature of the flask should not rise above 45ï‚°C. If necessary, cool the flask in a cold water bath. After the addition of toluene is complete, swirl the flask for 5 minutes, then pour the contents of the flask into 10 mL of water in a separatory funnel. Rinse the flask with 10 mL of ether and add the rinse to the separatory funnel. Gently mix the layers in the separatory funnel and allow them to separate. Remove the aqueous layer and discard. Wash the ether layer with 10 mL of 10% aqueous sodium bicarbonate solution. Remove the aqueous layer and discard. Wash the ether layer with 5 mL of water. Remove the aqueous layer and discard. Drain the ether layer into a small beaker and dry the ether layer over anhydrous sodium sulfate. Remove the drying agent from the solution and evaporate the ether to a volume of 1-2 mL. Determine the IR spectrum of your product mixture. Analyze the ether solution using gas chromatography. Dispose of all waste from this experiment in the appropriate waste containers as directed by your instructor."
