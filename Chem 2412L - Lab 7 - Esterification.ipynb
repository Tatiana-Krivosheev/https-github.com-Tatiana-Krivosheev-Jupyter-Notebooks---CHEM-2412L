    "Obtain ten test tubes and be sure to clean and dry each before the experiment.  Place labels on each test tube numbering from 1 to 10, and place all of them in a wooden test tube holder.  Table (1) below gives the 8 combinations of a carboxylic acid and an alcohol that should be placed in eight of the test tubes.  Place 10 drops of a given liquid carboxylic acid (or approximately 0.1 grams if the carboxylic acid is a solid) and 10 drops of the corresponding alcohol to the given carboxylic acid/alcohol pair into each test tube.  Now out of the unknown pairs (A1, A2),       (B1, B2), and (C1, C2), you will need to pick two pairs to react in the final two test tubes.  For the unknown combinations, use the same procedure (placing 10 drops of each component of the combination into the test tubes).  "
