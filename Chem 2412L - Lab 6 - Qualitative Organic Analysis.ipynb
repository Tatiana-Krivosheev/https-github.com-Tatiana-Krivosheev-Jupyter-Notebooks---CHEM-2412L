    "The identification and characterization of the structures of unknown substances are an important part of organic chemistry. Although it is often possible to establish the structure of a compound on the basis of spectra alone (IR, NMR, etc.), the spectra typically must be supplemented with other information about the compound: physical state and properties (melting point, boiling point, solubility, odor, color, etc.), elemental analysis, and confirmatory tests for functional groups.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this experiment you will carry out several qualitative tests that will allow you to identify functional groups in organic molecules. Each functional group has a particular set of properties that allow it to be identified. Some of these properties can be demonstrated by observing solubility behavior, while others can be seen in chemical reactions that are accompanied by color changes, precipitate formation, or other visible effects. You will then apply what you have learned by characterizing unknown organic compounds in terms of their functional group and solubility behavior. The functional groups you will examine include amines, alcohols, carboxylic acids, aldehydes, ketones, esters, alkyl halides, alkenes and aromatic compounds.\n",
    "\n",
    "The purpose of this experiment is to use qualitative analysis to identify the functional group present in one (or more) unknown compound(s), and then to use spectroscopic data to propose the structure of the compound. Be sure to record all observations, including the unknown number, in your laboratory notebook. \n",
    "\n",
    "**Physical Properties**  \n",
    "\n",
    "Procedure: Observe the appearance of your unknown, including color, physical state, odor, etc. If your unknown is a solid, determine its melting point. If the unknown is a liquid, observe its boiling point by distillation. Be sure to add a boiling stone and take care to distill slowly so that the temperature reading is accurate. \n",
    "\n",
    "**Solubility Classification**  \n",
    "\n",
    "The solubility of an organic compound in water, dilute acid, or dilute base can provide useful information about the presence or absence of certain functional groups. A flowchart showing the sequence of solubility tests along with the appropriate conclusions is shown in Figure 1.\n",
    "\n",
    "*Solubility in water*: Most organic compounds are not soluble in water, except for low molecular-weight amines and oxygen-containing compounds. Low molecular-weight compounds are generally limited to those with fewer than five carbon atoms.\n",
    "\n",
    "* Carboxylic acids with fewer than five carbon atoms are soluble in water and form solutions that give an acidic response (pH < 7) when tested with litmus paper.\n",
    "\n",
    "* Amines with fewer than five carbons are also soluble in water, and their solutions give a basic response (pH > 7) when tested with litmus paper.\n",
    "\n",
    "* Ketones, aldehydes, and alcohols with fewer than five carbon atoms are soluble in water and form neutral solutions (pH = 7).\n",
    " \n",
    "*Solubility in NaOH*: Solubility in 6M NaOH is a positive identification test for acids. A carboxylic acid that is insoluble in pure water will be soluble in base due to the formation of the sodium salt of the acid as the acid is neutralized by the base.\n",
    "\n",
    "*Solubility in HCl or H<sub>2</sub>SO<sub>4</sub>*: Solubility in acid (6M HCl or concentrated sulfuric acid) is a positive identification test for bases. Amines that are insoluble in pure water will be soluble in acid due to the formation of an ammonium chloride salt.\n",
    "\n",
    "Figure 1!!!\n",
    "\n",
    "Procedure: Solubility tests are done in the sequence: water, then base, and then acid. If your compound is soluble in water, you do not need to check for solubility in the basic or acidic solutions.\n",
    "\n",
    "*Solubility in Water*: Place 1 mL of water in a small test tube. Add 3 drops (or 50 mg of solid) of your compound (known or unknown) to the test tube. Thoroughly mix the contents of the test tube. Set the tube aside for 1 minute. If two layers form, or if the mixture is cloudy, consider the organic compound insoluble in water. If a transparent solution results, judge the sample to be soluble in water. Record your observations. For each of the compounds that dissolved in water, test a drop of the solution on a piece of litmus paper. Record the pH response as acidic, basic, or neutral.\n",
    "\n",
    "*Solubility in NaOH*: For the compounds that were insoluble in deionized water, test their solubility in NaOH, again using 1 mL of solution and 3 drops or a few crystals of the compound. Record your observations.\n",

    "*Solubility in 6M HCl or concentrated H<sub>2</sub>SO<sub>4</sub>*: Those compounds that were insoluble in pure water and NaOH should be tested in acid following the same procedure as before. Record your observations.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Beilstein Test**\n",
    "\n",
    "Halogens can be detected easily and reliably by the Beilstein test. It is the simplest method for determining the presence of a halogen, but does not differentiate among chlorine, bromine, and iodine. A positive Beilstein test results from the production of a volatile copper halide when an organic halide is heated with copper oxide. The copper halide imparts a blue-green color to the flame.\n",
    "\n",
    "Procedure: Heat the loop end of a copper wire in a Bunsen burner flame. After cooling, dip the wire directly into a small sample of the compound (known or unknown). Now, heat the wire in the Bunsen burner flame again (in the lower outside part of the flame). The compound will first burn. After the burning, a green flame will be produced if a halogen is present. Record your observations. Perform this test on bromobenzene and your unknown.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Chromic Acid Test**\n",
    "\n",
    "This test is based on the reduction of chromium(IV), which is orange, to chromium(III), which is green, when an alcohol is oxidized by the reagent. A change in color of the reagent from orange to green represents a positive test. Primary alcohols are oxidized by the reagent to carboxylic acids; secondary alcohols are oxidized to ketones. Tertiary alcohols are not oxidized at all by the reagent. Hence, this reaction can be used to distinguish tertiary alcohols form primary and secondary alcohols. Unlike some other tests for alcohols, this test can be used with all alcohols, regardless of molecular weight and solubility. Aldehydes are also result in a positive chromic acid test.\n",
    "\n",
    "Image!!!\n",
    "\n",
    "Procedure: Dissolve 3-4 drops of your compound (known or unknown) in 1 mL of acetone. Add 2 drops of chromic acid reagent and note the result that occurs. A positive test for a primary or secondary alcohol is the appearance of a blue-green color. Tertiary alcohols do not produce the test result, and the solution remains orange. Record your observations. Perform this test on 1-propanol, 2-butanol, phenol, propanal, and your unknown.\n",
    "\n",
    "*Note*: you may need to heat the test tube in a 60<sup>o</sup>C water bath for a few minutes to promote the reaction.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Ferric Chloride Test**\n",
    "\n",
    "A positive ferric chloride test indicates the presence of a phenolic hydroxyl group. A typical positive test results in the formation of a red or violet color. Some phenols will not react to this test due to the interfering presence of other substituents on the ring.\n",

    "**Iodoform Test**\n",
    "\n",
    "Methyl ketones (RCOCH<sub>3</sub>) react rapidly with iodine under basic conditions to give a carboxylate (RCO<sub>2</sub><sup>-</sup>) and iodoform (CHI<sub>3</sub>). Iodoform is a pale yellow solid, and its appearance indicates a positive test. \n",
    "\n",
    "Procedure: Dissolve 1 drop or 20 mg of your compound (known or unknown) in 0.5 mL of water (or 0.5 mL of methanol if the compound is not soluble in water. Add 0.5 mL of 10% aqueous NaOH. Add dropwise, with shaking, ~1 mL of KI<sub>3</sub> solution. Warm the solution slightly. Add a drop or two of NaOH to remove excess iodine, then dilute the mixture with water. Iodoform, if present, will separate. Perform this test on 2-octanone, 2-butanol, and your unknown.\n",
    "\n",
    "**2,4-Dinitrophenylhydrazine Test**\n",
    "\n",
    "This reagent reacts with ketones and aldehydes, and is used to distinguish these functional groups from other carbonyl compounds, such as esters, which do not react. The formation of a red or orange precipitate constitutes a positive text. Since the reagent contains sulfuric acid, amines may give a heavy precipitate of the amine sulfate, which appears yellow in the solution and can be mistaken for a positive test.\n",
    "\n",
    "Procedure: Prepare a solution of 4 drops of your compound (known or unknown) in 1 mL of ethanol. Add 1 mL of 2,4-dinitrophenylhydrazine reagent. Mix thoroughly and allow to stand. If no precipitate appears within 5 minutes, heat the solution in a hot water bath for 5 minutes and then allow it to cool to room temperature. Perform the test on propanal, 2-octanone, butyl amine, and your unknown.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Hinsberg Test**\n",
    "\n",
    "Primary and secondary amines react with benzenesulfonyl chloride in the presence of sodium hydroxide to give solid benzenesulfonamides.\n",
    "\n",
    "$$RNH_2 + C_6H_5SO_2Cl \\rightarrow RNHSO_2C_6H_5$$\n",
    "\n",
    "A positive test is indicated by the formation of a solid. The benzenesulfonamide from a primary amine is often soluble, but can be precipitated upon the addition of acid. Those from secondary amines are typically insoluble in water. Tertiary amines do not react.\n",
    "\n",
    "Procedure: Mix 50 mg or 2 drops of your compound (known or unknown) and 0.2 mL of benzenesulfonyl chloride in 4 mL of 10% aqueous NaOH solution. Stopper the test tube and shake vigorously until the oily sulfonyl chloride has reacted. Perform this test on butylamine, diethylamine, and your unknown.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Silver Nitrate Test**\n",
    "\n",
    "The reaction of an alkyl halide with silver nitrate in ethanol will result in the formation of a white or yellow silver halide precipitate that is insoluble in nitric acid. This reaction quite often proceeds slowly, and occasionally slight warming is necessary.\n",
    "\n",
    "$$RX + AgNO_3 \\rightarrow RONO_2 + AgX(s)$$\n",
    "\n",
    "It is important to check if the precipitate is soluble in dilute nitric acid. Carboxylic acids form insoluble silver salts that precipitate, but these dissolve in nitric acid whereas the silver halides do not.\n",
    "\n",
    "Procedure: In a test tube, dissolve 0.5 mL or 0.1 g of your compound (known or unknown) in 0.5 mL of ethanol. Add 0.5 mL of alcoholic silver nitrate solution. If no sign of a reaction is visible in 3 minutes at room temperature, warm the mixture in hot water. To ensure that the precipitate is a silver halide and not the salt of a carboxylic acid, add 0.5 mL of 6M HNO<sub>3</sub> to the solution with the precipitate. Stir the mixture. If the precipitate does not dissolve, you have a positive test for the alkyl halide. Record your observations. Perform this test on 1-bromobutane, benzoic acid, and your unknown.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Lucas Test**\n",
    "\n",
    "This test for alcohols depends on the appearance of an alkyl chloride as an insoluble second layer when an alcohol is treated with a mixture of hydrochloric acid and zinc chloride (Lucas reagent):\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ROH + HCl \\xrightarrow{ZnCl_2} RCl + H_2O$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Primary alcohols do not react at room temperature; therefore, the alcohol is seen simply to dissolve. Secondary alcohols will react slowly, whereas tertiary, benzylic, and allylic alcohols react instantly.\n",
    "\n",
    "Procedure: Place 2 mL of Lucas reagent in a test tube and add 3-4 drops of your compound (known or unknown). Stopper the test tube and shake vigorously. Tertiary alcohols give an immediate cloudiness in the solution as the insoluble alkyl halide separates from the aqueous solution. After a short time, the immiscible alkyl halide will form a separate layer. Secondary alcohols produce a cloudiness after 2-5 minutes. Primary alcohols dissolve in the reagent to give a clear solution. Some secondary alcohols may have to be heated slightly to encourage reaction with the reagent. Record your observations. Perform the test on 1-butanol, 2-butanol, t-butyl alcohol and your unknown.\n",
    "\n",
    "*Note*: this test often fails on alcohols with more than six carbon atoms\n",
    "\n",
    "**Bromination Test**\n",
    "\n",
    "Bromine readily adds across the carbon-carbon double bond of an alkene to produce a dibromoalkane. A red solution of bromine in methylene chloride will quickly become colorless as the addition reaction with the alkene takes place. The general equation describing the test is:\n",
    "\n",
    "Image!!!\n",
    "\n",
    "Procedure: Place 3 drops of your compound (known or unknown) in a test tube. Add 5 drops of Br<sub>2</sub> in CH<sub>2</sub>Cl<sub>2</sub> one drop at a time. Note what happens to the red bromine solution as it is added to each tube. Record your observations. Perform this test on cyclohexane, cyclohexene, and your unknown.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Potassium Permanganate Test**\n",
    "\n",
    "This test is positive for double and triple bonds but not for aromatic rings. It depends on the conversion of the purple ion MnO4- to a brown precipitate of MnO2 following the oxidation of an unsaturated compound. \n",
    "\n",
    "Image!!!\n",
    "\n",
    "Other easily oxidized compounds also give a positive test with potassium permanganate solution. These include aldehydes, some alcohols, phenols, and aromatic amines.\n",
    "\n",
    "Procedure: Dissolve 2 drops of a liquid or 25 mg of a solid compound (known or unknown) in 2 mL of water or ethanol. Slowly add 10-20 drops of the potassium permanganate solution drop-wise while shaking. In a positive test, the purple color of the reagent is discharged, and a brown precipitate of manganese dioxide forms, usually within 1 minute. If alcohol was the solvent, the solution should not be allowed to stand for more than 5 minutes because oxidation of the alcohol will begin slowly. Record your observations. Perform this test on cyclohexene, toluene, and your unknown.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Ignition Test**\n",
    "\n",
    "The presence of an aromatic ring or other centers of unsaturation will lead to the production of a sooty yellow flame in this test. Compounds that contain little oxygen and have a high carbon-to-hydrogen ratio burn at a low temperature with a yellow flame. Compounds that contain oxygen generally burn at a higher temperature with a clean blue flame.\n",
    "\n",
    "Procedure: Place a small amount of your compound (known or unknown) on a spatula and place it in the flame of a Bunsen burner. Observe whether a sooty flame is the result.
