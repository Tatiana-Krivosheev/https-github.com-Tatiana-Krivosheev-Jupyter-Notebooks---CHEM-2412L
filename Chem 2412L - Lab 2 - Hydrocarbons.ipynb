    "The following tests will illustrate general properties of hydrocarbons as well as differences in chemical reactivity due to type of hydrocarbon (saturated, unsaturated, or aromatic). Each test will be conducted using cyclohexane, cyclohexene, toluene, and two unknowns. Your goal is to determine the type of hydrocarbon of each unknown. Record your results in your laboratory notebook.\n",
    "\n",
    "1.\t**Solubility**: Place 2 mL of water in a test tube and add 2 or 3 drops of the hydrocarbon to be tested. Shake the mixture to determine whether the hydrocarbon is soluble. Look carefully for a second layer, which may be hard to see. If you are not certain if there is a second layer, add more of the hydrocarbon to the test tube. Keep these samples for the density test.\n",
    "\n",
    "2.\t**Density**: reexamine the mixtures prepared for the solubility test and decide in each case whether the hydrocarbon is more dense or less dense than water.  Once you are finished recording your observations, discard these samples in the non-halogenated organic waste container found in the ventilation hood.\n",
    "\n",
    "3.\t**Flammability**: Place 2 or 3 drops of the pure hydrocarbon on an evaporating dish in the hood and ignite it with a match. Note the nature of the flame (sooty flames are characteristic of unsaturated compounds). When the hydrocarbon has finished burning, clean and dry the evaporating dishes.\n",
    "\n",
    "4.\t**Addition of bromine**: Dissolve 3 or 4 drops of the pure hydrocarbon in 1 mL of methylene chloride in a test tube. Add a few drops of a solution of bromine in methylene chloride while shaking the test tube. The loss of color from the bromine solution indicates the presence of an unsaturated compound. Once you are finished recording your observations, discard these samples in the halogenated organic waste container found in the ventilation hood.\n",
    "\n",
    "5.\t**Reaction with potassium permanganate**: Dissolve 3 or 4 drops of the pure hydrocarbon in 1 mL of acetone in a test tube. Add a few drops of potassium permanganate solution while shaking. The change of color of the potassium permanganate solution indicates the presence of an unsaturated compound. Once you are finished recording your observations, discard these samples in the non-halogenated organic waste container found in the ventilation hood.\n",
    "\n",
    "6.\t**Reaction with sulfuric acid**: Place 1 mL of concentrated sulfuric acid in a test tube. Add 3 or 4 drops of pure hydrocarbon one drop at a time. A reaction is indicated by the dissolution of the hydrocarbon and by a change in color, production of heat, or formation of insoluble material. If no reaction occurs, warm the mixture in a hot water bath, being careful not to evaporate the hydrocarbon. Aromatic hydrocarbons will react with warm sulfuric acid to form a sulfonic acid, which will dissolve.  Once you are finished recording your observations, discard these samples in the non-halogenated organic waste container found in the ventilation hood.\n"
